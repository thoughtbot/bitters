  `$base-background-color` as their `background-color`. ([#296])

  set the `background-color` of the `html` element. ([#296])

- The value of `$base-spacing` is no longer derived from `$base-line-height`.
  ([#292])
- The color of button text is now set using Bourbon's

  element. ([#279])

  `[type="checkbox"]`, `[type="radio"]`, `[type="file"]`, `select`) is now solid
  and offset from the element. ([#284])

### Removed

- Removed `$base-font-size` in favor of more specific implementations specific
  to the particular object being modified. ([#272])
